### Explanation of Subqueries and Joins

#### Subqueries
A **subquery** is a query nested within another SQL query, often enclosed in parentheses. Subqueries can be used in various parts of an SQL statement, like the `WHERE`, `FROM`, and `SELECT` clauses, and return values that the main query can use. They are helpful when we need to filter or compute values based on other data in the database.

For example, in:
```sql
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE project_id = (SELECT project_id FROM projects WHERE project_name = 'Project Alpha');
```
the subquery `(SELECT project_id FROM projects WHERE project_name = 'Project Alpha')` finds the `project_id` for "Project Alpha," which the main query then uses to select the relevant tasks.

#### Joins
**Joins** allow combining data from multiple tables by relating them based on common columns. Joins generally perform faster than subqueries because they directly pull and filter data across tables rather than having the database execute separate queries and combine the results later.

For instance:
```sql
SELECT users.name, projects.project_name FROM users
JOIN tasks ON users.user_id = tasks.user_id
JOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.project_id;
```
Here, `JOIN` retrieves data from the `users`, `tasks`, and `projects` tables based on matching user and project IDs.

While subqueries are often more readable in straightforward cases, joins can be preferable for more complex relationships or performance-intensive queries.

### Code Explanation Line by Line

This code creates queries to fetch different information from `users`, `projects`, and `tasks` tables in the `project_manager_db` database. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each line and query:

1. **Create a Database and Tables**  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE project_manager_db;
   \c project_manager_db
   ```
   Creates a new database, `project_manager_db`, and connects to it.

2. **UUID Generation Extension**
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
   ```
   Installs the `uuid-ossp` extension for generating UUIDs in PostgreSQL.

3. **Define Tables**  
   Three tables are defined:
   - `users` stores user details.
   - `projects` stores project details.
   - `tasks` stores task details, including associations with `users` and `projects`.

4. **Insert Sample Data**  
   Inserts sample users, projects, and tasks into the respective tables.

### Queries and Their Explanations

#### Fetching Data Based on Conditions and Aggregations

1. **Tasks for 'Project Alpha'**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE project_id = (SELECT project_id FROM projects WHERE project_name = 'Project Alpha');
   ```
   Fetches all tasks associated with "Project Alpha" using a subquery to get the project ID.

2. **Tasks Assigned to Catherine Green**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = 'catherine.green@example.com');
   ```
   Retrieves tasks assigned to Catherine by using a subquery to obtain her `user_id`.

3. **Users with More Than 20 Hours Worked**
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, name FROM users WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM tasks GROUP BY user_id HAVING SUM(hours_worked) > 20);
   ```
   Finds users who worked more than 20 hours by grouping `tasks` by `user_id` and using `HAVING` with `SUM(hours_worked)`.

4. **Users with Fewer Than 10 Hours Worked**
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, name FROM users WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM tasks GROUP BY user_id HAVING SUM(hours_worked) < 10);
   ```
   Similar to the previous query but filters for users with fewer than 10 hours worked.

5. **Users with Less Than 10 Hours on 'In Progress' Tasks**
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, name FROM users WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM tasks WHERE status = 'In Progress' GROUP BY user_id HAVING SUM(hours_worked) < 10);
   ```
   Returns users who have less than 10 hours on tasks with a status of "In Progress".

6. **Project with Most Hours Worked**
   ```sql
   SELECT project_id, project_name FROM projects WHERE project_id = (SELECT project_id FROM tasks GROUP BY project_id ORDER BY SUM(hours_worked) DESC LIMIT 1);
   ```
   Finds the project with the highest total hours worked by ordering projects in descending order of `SUM(hours_worked)`.

7. **Projects Ordered by Total Hours Worked**
   ```sql
   SELECT project_id, project_name FROM projects WHERE project_id IN (SELECT project_id FROM tasks GROUP BY project_id ORDER BY SUM(hours_worked) DESC);
   ```
   Lists all projects ordered by the total hours worked in descending order.

8. **Projects with Completed Tasks**
   ```sql
   SELECT project_id, project_name FROM projects WHERE project_id IN (SELECT project_id FROM tasks WHERE status = 'Completed');
   ```
   Lists projects with at least one task marked as "Completed."

9. **Users with Completed Tasks**
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, name FROM users WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM tasks WHERE status = 'Completed');
   ```
   Lists users who have at least one completed task.

10. **Users Assigned to Only One Project**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM tasks GROUP BY user_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT project_id) = 1);
    ```
    Finds users who are only working on a single project by grouping tasks by `user_id` and counting unique `project_id`.

11. **Task Name and Project Name**
    ```sql
    SELECT task_name, (SELECT project_name FROM projects WHERE projects.project_id = tasks.project_id) AS project_name FROM tasks;
    ```
    Shows each task's name alongside the associated project name using a subquery.

12. **Project Total Hours Worked**
    ```sql
    SELECT project_name, (SELECT SUM(hours_worked) FROM tasks WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.project_id) AS total_hours FROM projects ORDER BY total_hours;
    ```
    Lists each project along with the total hours worked, ordered by total hours.

13. **Completed Tasks Count Per Project**
    ```sql
    SELECT project_name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.project_id AND status = 'Completed') AS completed_tasks_count FROM projects;
    ```
    Shows the number of completed tasks for each project.

14. **Average Hours Worked per Project**
    ```sql
    SELECT project_name, (SELECT AVG(hours_worked) FROM tasks WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.project_id) AS average_hours FROM projects ORDER BY average_hours;
    ```
    Displays each project and the average hours worked on it.

15. **Users Working on Completed Projects**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE user_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM tasks WHERE project_id IN (
            SELECT project_id FROM projects WHERE end_date IS NOT NULL
        )
    );
    ```
    Finds users assigned to projects that have been completed (`end_date IS NOT NULL`).

16. **Users Working on Ongoing Projects**
    ```sql
    SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE user_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM tasks WHERE project_id IN (
            SELECT project_id FROM projects WHERE end_date IS NULL
        )
    );
    ```
    Lists users working on projects that are still ongoing (`end_date IS NULL`).
